Python for Informatics: Exploring Information
=============================================

Python for Informatics is designed to introduce students to programming and 
software development through the lens of exploring data.   You can think of 
the Python programming language as your tool to solve data problems that are 
far beyond the capability of a spreadsheet.

I hope you find the book useful and hope to make it as easy as possible for teachers
to adopt and use this book by providing these materials.

If you are interested in a book that teaches Python from the perspective of
a Computer Scientist, I recommend "Think Python" written by Allen B. Downey 
or the "Interactive Python" web site:

* Interactive Python - http://interactivepython.org/

If you are an absolute beginner at programming, Python for Informatics is 
likely the best starting point for your programming learning.   Once you 
understand the basics of programming from this book and its associated 
materials, you will be better prepared to learn from the more 
advanced books.
